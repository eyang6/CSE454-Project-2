# Time Series Analysis of Synthetic Dataset
Representation of datasets using Piecewise Aggregate Approximation and Symbolic Aggregate Approximation

## Purpose
Predict and compare temporal datasets with and without the use of PAA

## Usage
1. Run the code in either the Matlab IDE or the Matlab online compiler
2. The code may be edited to output plots of the PAA representation against the original data set
3. The code may be edited to display the confusion matrix of each classification
